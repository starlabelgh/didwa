# didwa
# Is an Open-soure POS Management System with Extra Essensial Business Core Features, built to
# solve operational inefficiencies in SME's in Ghana and Africa as awhole.

# Solutions for African Problems, Built By African.

# Records keeping and easily tracking business fincancial flow is big heache for SME's in Ghana,
# making them very inefficient and inability to raise capital to expand to internal business.

# Do you know with a very good system like Didwa, business are able to cutdown cumbersome
# staff sales delays, petty theft and good overview of business standing. 

# Base Idea
# This is a personal project am working on to help MSME's in Ghana, Africa to
# use for the daily management of their business operations.

# Is a POS Management System built with PHP and AdminLTE library.

# Design
# The system is being built with active users that are currently using the system
# with different customization function. Their feedback new feature requirements, bugs
# and recommendations are being used to make the system better each and every push to main.

# There are existing POS softwares but 99% are custom built and these businesses expecially MSME's
# with not that much financial strength and somewhat very complicated business operation makes it
# very inconvinient for them to adopt these softwares. They need very simple systems but yet contain
# all or most relevant features to solve their problems. This is what Didwa is built for and does best.

# It totally doesnt do the best job for them, making these systems useless for them.
# So I thought of why not built solutions by Africans to solve African problems.

# Feel free to make a pull request to contribute.

# Request for the db and use config file in the db folder to connect to the database.
# Woala, you're in.
